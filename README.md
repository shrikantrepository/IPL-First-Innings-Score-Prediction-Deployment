# IPL-First-Innings-Score-Prediction-Deployment
### Project Overview
1. *Created a model that predicts the score (in terms of range) of IPL matches*
1. *Engineered features ....*
3. *Optimized Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model*


### Resources Used
1. *Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn*
1. *Dataset by Shivam Mitra: https://github.com/codophobia/CricketScorePredictor*

### Data Cleaning
1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

### Feature Engineering
1. *Transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables*
2. *Split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%*

### Model Building
#### Algorithms used for this project are as follows:
1. *Multiple Linear Regression*
2. *Decision Tree*
3. *Random Forest*
4. *Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)*

### Model Evaluation
Used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric

### Future Scope
1. *Add columns in dataset of top batsmen and bowlers of all the teams.*
2. *Add columns that consists of striker and non-striker's strike rates.*
3. *Implement this problem statement using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).*
